# Integrating a Custom Domain into Microsoft 365  

## 📌 Project Overview  
In this personal lab project, I successfully integrated a custom domain (**miguel-k.com**) into **Microsoft 365**. This involved purchasing the domain, verifying ownership, and configuring the required **DNS records** to enable email and other Microsoft 365 services. The goal was to simulate a real-world IT setup and gain hands-on experience with domain management in a cloud environment.  

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools Used  
- **Microsoft 365 Admin Center** – Domain and user management  
- **DNS Management** – Configuring CNAME, TXT, and MX records  
- **Domain Registrar** – Hosting and modifying DNS settings  

## 🛠️ Project Steps  
1. **Domain Registration** – Purchased **miguel-k.com** for integration with Microsoft 365.  
2. **Verification Process** – Initiated and completed domain verification in the **Microsoft 365 Admin Center**.  
3. **DNS Configuration** – Updated **CNAME, TXT, and MX records** to align with Microsoft 365 services.  
4. **Final Setup** – Successfully added the domain and enabled user creation with the custom domain name.  

## 🎯 Key Takeaways  
- Gained hands-on experience in **Microsoft 365 domain integration**.  
- Learned how to configure **DNS records** for cloud services.  
- Understood the process of managing users with a **custom domain** in a business setting.
